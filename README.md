## About
I am a software engineer focused on building scalable backend systems, MLOps pipelines, and proactive infrastructure. My work bridges the gap between machine learning research and production-grade deployment, with a particular interest in container orchestration and miniature language models.

## Current Projects
* **Proactive Container Orchestration:** Developing an intelligent scaling system using LSTM-based predictive models to optimize resource allocation and minimize latency in containerized environments.
* **Mini-LLM-Forge:** Building an end-to-end MLOps pipeline designed to fine-tune and serve miniature Large Language Models (LLMs) using FastAPI and Docker.
* **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs):** Researching efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by exploiting symmetry in neural architectures to improve uncertainty estimation.
* **SDR Weather Imaging:** Implementing Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems to receive and decode real-time meteorological data from NOAA satellites.

## Technical Arsenal

### Primary Competencies
* **Languages:** Python (Advanced), C++, JavaScript (ES6+), SQL
* **Frameworks & Tools:** FastAPI, Node.js, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker
* **Data Systems:** PostgreSQL, Vector Databases (ChromaDB/Qdrant)

### Currently Exploring (Learning Phase)
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) and advanced Helm charting.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform for automated cloud provisioning.
* **LLM Optimization:** Quantization techniques and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline architecture.

## Education & Experience
* **Student at Amrita School of AI:** Focusing on the intersection of AI, Systems, and Software Engineering.
* **Backend Engineering:** Experience in designing RESTful APIs, containerizing microservices, and implementing CI/CD workflows.
